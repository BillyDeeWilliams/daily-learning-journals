#LJ Code 201 - Day 4


Thursday Nov, 10th

I consider today to be my best day thus far in the 201 class. I attribute this to several different factors.

**** personal/ human/ William variables ****

Sleep-
Although I did not finish working on the lab assignment until about 1:30am I was still able to get up around 7 am this morning, a goal that I have been striving towards for almost two weeks now, being used to waking up around 9am regularly. I have prior commitments to be completed 2x a week in the morning before class and in order to meet them I will need to regularly be up and ready to leave the house by 7 - 7:15 am.

Eat-
I am bad at eating. especially breakfast. The older i get, the more i recognize the seriousness of the implications/ affects of not meeting this basic need. This morning I was awake long enough to eat some breakfast at home before leaving for class. It usually takes me at least 30 min, and often several hours before I can being to feel hungry or comfortable ingesting anything solid. I often feel sick in the mornings for an hour or 4, unless I manage to eat breakfast within the short window period of 'morning hunger' that lasts from about 30 to 70 min after getting out of bed. I have been aware of these 'truths' for some time but today having the opportunity to experience the difference it makes to get some good food in my body first thing in the day, the importance has been highlighted in a very hard to disregard way.

Caffiene-
Too much is very bad. Its super easy to overdue it and really difficult to keep it under control. The plan is to stick to a late and one cuppa caffe in the morning and then strictly cuppa tea time for the rest of the day, with maybe one last caffe in the afternoon. It is even more important to make sure I eat when drinking this much caffiene. The fatigue from the change in sleep style and overall not-so great sleep hygiene makes the ubiquitous stimulant much more appealing than usual.


*** Classwork Variables ****

I was able to complete the assignment to a place that I felt was as 'done' as I was capable of getting on my own, and i felt good about the logic solutions I developed.
I felt ready and as if i knew what to expect when class began today, this set a good working president for the rest of the day.
The collaboration lab was challenging but also really cool, the benefit from working with others (affiliates, collaboration) is unparalleled.


IN CLASS TODAY:

pair coding ,  was awesome. More than one hi-5 was shared between my coding partner and I as we successfully surmounted the obstacles that were waiting for us in todays lab.
 by far the hardest part for me was staying calm when things were not working and staying patient while trying to facilitate effective communication between two or more persons,
 myself often included, who are unclear on and possibly misinformed about the very ideas, concepts, and practical applications which those persons are attempting to communicate about.

  ie. how do you talk to people about something you don't know about which they may not know about either.
  ie. misunderstanding. new complicated concepts, especially because they deal with multiple 'languages' and 'flavors' of those languages (like spoken vs. written english, pseudo code, javascript, etc.)

possible solutions: meditation. compassion/empathy. get to know the other people around me. Learn from everyone.

if there is something about how another person operates or how events are unfolding  in our world that is causing me undue anxiety,
 the true reason for that anxiety is NOT that event or person and their behaviors/attitudes,
and further in my experience, to discover the actual 'why' of the undue anxiety is always a rewarding endeavor.
 Especially in an academic milieu it is important to actively remember to learn from the people and situations that I find especially difficult,
  these events can be reframed as special opportunities for extra rewarding/ beneficial growth (personal and/or academic).
