#LJ Code 201 - Day 10
#Friday!

"Today was a good day" -Ice Cube
Today was great. We did some review of the week which is always helpful. We focused mainly on CSS and those days always feel much less stressful than JS days. The most difficult tasks of the day for me involved interacting with GIT and doing PR of repos that other users had created, basic colab protocol, this was about my 1.5 time doing that. Last week we did a similar activity during pair programming but I was mostly walked through the process concerning the GIT stuff and proceeded to continue without a good understanding of what had been accomplished.

Every day I feel more and more accomplished and comfortable using the tools that I have just been introduced to in the last week. GIT for all my trouble, I am using it successfully (mostly) and not stumbling nearly as much as I had been. the JS logic is starting to become intuitive.
even my ability to implement css is improving, in fact I would say it is already surpassing, at least in terms of understanding, the level I was at a few years ago when I was enrolled in css class at PCC/MHCC! the text and the teachers here are phenomenal!

Looking forward to the break.
My goals include:
-Put the finish and perfect the labs from this week.
-go back to my web pages from week one and shine them up
-submit discussion posts and complete all readings
-complete some codecademy tutorial and begin to familiarize with code wars
-finish css for entire cookie store site,
-complete css for Friday lab challenge
-meet stretch goals for all labs
-go back through grades and pick up any points I can
-start brainstorming ideas for final project
-begin 301 enrollment process

Class concerns
.... some stuff happened in class today that involved a member of the staff that really bothered me and made me feel uncomfortable. I will do my best to reflect this in the weekly survey. If I am unable to do so and it continues to be an issue I will address the issue via the appropriate channels w/in the CodeFellows organization. Trying to remain GENERAL in this particular description, I will say that it is not a huge issue and more to do with appropriate, professional conduct/ student interaction by the TA's.

In summation, I'm really glad we have the week off to catch up. THough it feels like we have an advantage that other 201 students have not had in the past. I am a lot more behind that Id like (though not so behind that Im seriously worried about being able to catch up before class 11) I have gotten "into the swing" of the day to day and have developed successful study habits that I believe will prevent me from ever falling behind again. So grateful for this opportunity and I am really enjoying it. I think the most difficult part for me is working with some of the more difficult, less considerate/mindful personalities.  On a whole everybody is very kind and there is a good feeling of support from with the entire community ant Code Fellows and especially with in my 'Cohort".
