#LJ Code 201 - Day 8

Wednesday-
Traditionally Wednesday is spaghetti day, but not today.
Today was a little rough for me.
so this is not going to be a typical entry. Im not sure if anyone reads these, but if you do... well I hope you don't.
Today got ontop of me for a minute or two and I know there no shame in it but it sucks to say all the same.
I dont like feeling this behind
I think Im really doing okay so far as the course is concerned so far even if it feels like Im completely overwhelmed at times.
In addition to the stressors of the class, Im finding it a little more difficult than I had anticipated to spend so much time downtown.
Sometimes its hard to feel like I belong in school, doing web dev, in this milieu, and the feelings of being overwhelmed start to become evidence that Im out of my depth, or like reaching too far.
I have a lot of privilege in my life right now. a lot. Certainly a lot more that I have had for most of my life, most of the last decade.
I believe I am smart and capable. and I want to make better options for myself I want to improve my station and I believe I am capable and now I have the opportunity
to do so here at Code Fellows. But its new yeah? and Im not familiar with any of this. I haven't been a student like this is several lifetimes and when I was I didnt do as well then as I am now, not even close. I didn't apply myself like this, I didn't prioritize being a student then and now I really do. SO im getting closer and closer and doing hard work to manifest something new and different and rad in my life. None of it is familiar though. and its unsettling, its just a little uncomfortable, sometimes a lot uncomfortable. And I get to see everyday a hundred real life examples of why its so important that I succeed and what I dont want to be, and sometimes I think I to myself that Im not fooling anybody, that its clear to everybody but me that I dont belong in the world of decent folk no matter how hard I try to just be good, productive helpful compassionate intelligent person.
But then I take some deep breaths
and maybe I write it down in a journal just like this.
And I know its all bullshit and I know that I get to chose the story I dance to today, and in addition to being a shit story, its actually hurting my chances at success in this and I KNOW, I fucking know, I know deep down in my bones, in my heart's vagina that
#success is destiny.
