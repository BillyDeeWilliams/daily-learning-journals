Learning Journal Day 2
November 8th 2016
Election Day
*sigh*


#Notes:
js handles data types casually
its good to be explicit as much as possible, even if not perfectly necessary
keep track of branches(draw it if needed)

HTML element:
[margin [border [padding [content] padding ] border ] margin ]

branching:
always branch from master
commands:
branch:
lists branches
-d deletes
checkout :
checks out of current branch and into another
-b create the destination branch before checking into it

git push origin master
git push remote_name local_branch

GIT:  create/modify > add > commit > push

#questions:

#takeaway:
