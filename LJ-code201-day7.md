NOTES:

they move way too fast in class, gotta find a way to take notes and follow along at the same time cuz right now if i take notes, i miss whats going on but then I have a good record and helpful notes, or I can follow and really get it but because ive never done it the notes would be really helpful and i end up googling stuff I know i could have just remembered from class....
the kids needs drink :p ughs.
