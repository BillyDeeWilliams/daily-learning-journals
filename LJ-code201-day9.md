#LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Thursday

Better and better. Things are looking up from yesterday. Ive got the logic in some of the harder parts of the assignments working and my csss is starting to take form. I have a good written plan for how I want my lab9 to look like and a sketched out plan in my notes.

CSS NOTES:
Positioning:

Relative:
relative to where it "should be"
stays in the flow
a good way to change "position" without actually movie element

Absolute:
positions relative to nearest positioned ancestor
takes element out of flow


Fixed:
relative to the window
out of flow
