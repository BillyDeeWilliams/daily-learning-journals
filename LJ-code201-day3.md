#LJ Code 201 - Day 3


Wednesday
11/9/16

had some trouble today grasping the mechanics of github merge/pull/push remote-local relationships.
I have a better grasp now, and will no longer be repeatedly creating merge conflicts by modifying things locally in branches that had already been merged into master remotely.

CSS needs works still but practice is coming along.
found that planning and writing out on paper is INVALUABLE! made coding so much easier and I surprised myself with some different and I believe stronger (with respect to
  architecture) style of problem solving strategies. specifically the first 5 yes/no questions in the lab today, I intuitively created an effective loop to cycle through array elements the number of times i wanted- in the past this has required more critical thought/planning, basically it was harder before, noticeably so.  

  Questions..

  see comments in code files. look for 'QUESTION' in comments
